1. Introduction
As cloud computing has become universal for personal and organizational data storage, concerns about privacy, unauthorized access, and breaches have intensified. Traditional cloud storage services rely on server-side encryption, where the provider manages the encryption keys and therefore retains technical access to user data. This model exposes users to insider threats, data leaks, and legal requests compelling providers to disclose sensitive information (TransferChain, 2023). In response, security researchers and privacy-focused companies have increasingly promoted end-to-end encryption (E2EE) and client-side encryption (CSE) as solutions that remove trust in the server entirely. These approaches ensure that only the data owner and authorized recipients possess the decryption keys, transforming the cloud into a “blind” storage medium (Proton, 2024).

2. Client-Side Encryption and Zero-Knowledge Cloud Storage
Client-side encryption (CSE) refers to encrypting data on the user’s device before it is transmitted to the cloud. The cloud provider never sees plaintext or key material. When implemented rigorously, CSE produces zero-knowledge or zero-access cloud storage — meaning the provider has no ability to decrypt user data (pCloud, 2023). This design provides strong protection even in the event of service provider compromise, malicious administrators, or government subpoenas (Proton, 2024).
Zero-knowledge systems have been adopted by numerous privacy-oriented platforms and studied extensively in academic literature, which confirms that the approach greatly reduces the attack surface by eliminating server-side key exposure (da Rocha et al., 2020). The model shifts responsibility to the user, who becomes the sole custodian of decryption keys.

3. End-to-End Encryption for File-Sharing
In file-sharing systems, E2EE ensures that encryption occurs before the data leaves the sender’s device and decryption occurs only on authorized devices. The storage server merely holds encrypted blobs and cannot assist attackers by leaking keys or plaintext (1Kosmos, 2024). Because the server cannot read the content, the system protects both confidentiality and integrity — especially when combined with authenticated encryption schemes.
E2EE is widely used in secure messaging but is equally important in file storage. Studies of cloud platforms show that many so-called “encrypted” services fail to implement true end-to-end security because they still control key material (Hofmann & Truong, 2024). Proper E2EE avoids this pitfall entirely.

4. Cryptographic Foundations: AES-GCM and Key Derivation
Most secure file-sharing systems use symmetric encryption for encrypting the file payload because of its speed. A widely recommended standard is AES-256-GCM, which is an authenticated encryption mode that provides confidentiality and tamper detection (pCloud, 2023). Each encrypted file must use a unique initialization vector (IV) to avoid predictable ciphertext patterns.
A major challenge in E2EE systems is generating strong encryption keys. Deriving keys directly from user passphrases using simple hashing (e.g., SHA-256) is inadequate because it lacks salts and sufficient computational hardness. Research strongly recommends using key derivation functions (KDFs) such as PBKDF2, scrypt, or Argon2, which apply repeated hashing and introduce randomness to resist brute-force attacks (da Rocha et al., 2020).
Multi-user sharing requires either distributing passphrases securely or using hybrid encryption: the file is encrypted with a symmetric key, and this key is then encrypted with each recipient’s public key. This technique prevents sharing the user’s main passphrase and enables secure revocation without re-encrypting the entire file (Hofmann & Truong, 2024).

5. Access Control in Encrypted File Systems
File-sharing platforms implement access control to regulate which users can retrieve ciphertext and attempt decryption. In simple implementations, this may rely on user authentication (email/password) and access lists stored on the server. More advanced models combine server-side access control with cryptographic key wrapping, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot decrypt even if they bypass application-level checks (Khalaf and Kadi, 2017).Access control intertwines with encryption: sharing must be usable, but secure. This trade-off is a recurring challenge in E2EE storage design, particularly in collaborative scenarios. Academic analyses highlight that improperly implemented sharing workflows are among the most common points of failure (Hofmann & Truong, 2024).

6. Security Benefits and Remaining Challenges
End-to-end encryption and client-side encryption provide strong protection in cloud environments because the server never receives decryption keys, meaning even a full server breach reveals only unreadable ciphertext (Proton, 2024). This removes a major vulnerability present in traditional cloud storage, where providers control the keys. Additionally, using authenticated encryption modes such as AES-GCM ensures both confidentiality and integrity, as any unauthorized modification of stored data is detected during decryption (pCloud, 2023).
However, these security benefits come with practical challenges. Key management becomes the sole responsibility of the user, and losing a passphrase or key results in permanent loss of access because no server-held recovery mechanism exists (da Rocha et al., 2020). Usability is also affected: features like server-side searching, automatic previews, or data indexing cannot be offered without exposing plaintext, which means E2EE systems must sacrifice convenience to preserve privacy (TransferChain, 2023). Finally, secure sharing introduces additional complexity. Studies show that many real-world E2EE storage systems still contain weaknesses in their sharing or device-onboarding mechanisms, demonstrating that designing secure key distribution is difficult in practice (Hofmann & Truong, 2024). Despite these challenges, E2EE remains one of the most effective approaches for protecting sensitive cloud-stored data.

7. Conclusion
End-to-end encrypted and client-side encrypted file-sharing systems offer robust protection for sensitive information by ensuring that only users — not servers — hold decryption keys. AES-GCM, strong key derivation, and zero-knowledge principles provide confidentiality, integrity, and resistance to server-side compromise. Although challenges remain, particularly around key management and secure sharing, properly implemented E2EE storage represents one of the most secure solutions for modern cloud environments.
