How to Run the Project
SecureShare 

Ensure Firebase project is set up. (firebase.google.com)

Install Visual Studio Code.
Install GitBASH.
In VSC, install Flutter and Dart extensions. 
Move the project to a short, writable path (e.g., C:\src\garfriend).
Run tests if you want: flutter test.
Optional health check: flutter doctor
Run flutter pub get which installs all the dependencies listed in your project’s pubspec.yaml file
If you’re serving a built bundle, rebuild first: flutter build web.
Start with flutter run -d chrome (or restart the current run with a hot restart/Shift+R).



Run:

flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome

Web is required because download uses dart:html.
